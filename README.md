# Instructions for development

This project was developed using the yarn package manager. Find out how to install yarn for your operating system. After cloning this project, go into the root folder and run `yarn install`. Once that is done, run `yarn global add gatsby-cli`. This will add the gatsby-cli as a global executable. Run `yarn global bin` to see where it has been installed. If this location is not part of your PATH environment variable, add the pathname as to PATH as well. If gatsby has been installed successfully, running `gatsby --version` will show you the version of the installed executable.

Thereafter, develop using `gatsby develop` or `yarn start`. The webapp will be running on `http://localhost:8000/`.
