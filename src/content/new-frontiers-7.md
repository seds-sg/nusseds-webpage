### Speaker Bio:

Dr. Bidushi Bhattacharya is an ex-NASA scientist-turned-astropreneur. She is Founder of Astropreneurs HUB (astropreneurs-hub.com), a Singapore- and US-based startup dedicated to space workforce development through software solutions and sector-related training. Her previous experience includes over two decades with NASA as a scientist and engineer on projects have including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Mars Rover Program, the Galileo Mission to Jupiter, the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, and others.

### Talk Summary:

Much emphasis has been placed on engineering as Singapore enters the NewSpace Race. While this serves as the base for the NewSpace ecosystem, we need many more hands on deck, from all disciplines, to adequately meet future demand.

Innovations and out-of-the-box thinking will become particularly important as the sector seeks new technology and support services in the coming 3-5 years. Who are today’s and tomorrow’s player in space entrepreneurship, or astropreneurship? What areas of NewSpace receive the most funding? And, most importantly, how can you get involved?
