Welcome back to school! Students and researchers from NUS have launched multiple nanosatelites called CubeSats into space. One such launch is **Galassia**.

Find out from ex-students Zhen Ning and Eugene Ee who helped launch this mission how NUS is helping push us ahead in the space race and what you can do to be a part of it. This talk is open and free for all members of the public. In this era of exploring out-of-the-world objects, we need out-of-the-box thinking and that requires students with diverse perspectives. 

Come and join us to make the future of space exploration.

This is also our first event for this semester. As such, in addition to the talk by our guest speakers, we will  be having our Welcome Tea for the semester. If you just got to know us and are keen to know more about what we do, our friendly core team members will be happy to share with you about our activities! We will also have a short intro to NUS SEDS before the speakers take the stage.
