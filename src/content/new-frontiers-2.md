## Speaker Bio:

Having enjoyed learning about both computer hardware and software, Akshat graduated from NUS Computer Engineering in 2016. Right after graduation, he worked as a research assistant at NUS, hoping to accelerate neural network inference on power constrained devices using low cost FPGA SoCs. He developed a software framework to automatically optimize convolutional neural networks to balance loads across the heterogeneous processing elements on an FPGA SoC.
